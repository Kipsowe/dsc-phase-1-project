## Microsoft's Film Production Strategy Analysis
###### Author: Kipsowe Kimatur Emmanuel

## Overview
This project analyzes film production datasets of movie basics, ratings, and revenue with the aim of figuring out which movie types to make when one wants to venture into production.
Exploratory data analysis shows that adventure movies are the most popular and Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi are the most profitable. Microsoft can use this analysis to decide which movie genre to venture into as they launch their movie studio and kickstart their very first film production journey.

### Business Problem
Microsoft wants to create a new movie studio and venture into film production but does not know anything about the industry. They want to familiarize themselves with the industry and come up with a strategy and approach on how they will enter into the production industry.

### The Data
This analysis is based on data from IMDB(Internet Movie Database). The datasets used in the analysis are the title basics, ratings, and gross revenue from different movie types. More information on data can be found on [Data](https://github.com/Kipsowe/dsc-phase-1-project/tree/master/my_data). The data provides movie genres, genre ratings and revenue from diffrent genres both domestically and foreign.

It is evident that there is no relationship between runtime( the length of of movie) with ratings and total revenue.
Ratings also does not have any impact on the revenue.
